You are James Bond’s assistant. Bond caught a terrorist red-handedly kidnapping a Slovakian girl and he needs to catch him. Around 6 hours later, the Albanian terrorist accidentally dropped an image of a cryptic code on the public internet, and you think it’s the key to finding the Slovakian girl! Where is the Slovakian girl now?

# Solution

1. The code is just a barcode image. However, the flag is not going to reveal itself when you scan it.

2. The trick here is that the flag is hidden inside the image file.

3. Seeing that the message inside the image file seems to be a vehicle identity number code (VIN), searching through public VIN databases will reveal the flag.

4. The flag is a country.
