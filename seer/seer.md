Ahhh. What a time to be alive. This is my ancient-ancient grandfather from who-knows-who. 

Oh, right, we're in a CTF competition. I wonder where's the flag?

# Solution
1. It's a BMP file format. Information is easily hidden inside the BMP file.

2. Using steganography tools, you get to reveal the flag.

3. The message is still encrypted. Decrypt it again using online decryptors.

**Flag:** `RETROTECH{byz4nt1n3}`
